# Find Potential Demand Using Propagation Clustering Algorithm in Javascript
This widget is Analysis using arcgis javascirpt geometry API. 



![App](https://github.com/anggaGPS/Web-App-Builder/blob/master/PotensiPelangganTelkom.JPG)

## Features
this widget is for analysis costumer potential by spatial query from demand data then find the best path and distance to Distribution Point (Telecommunitaion Networking) using Propagation Clustering Algorithm


## Formula
1. Selection among Exisitng Costumer that has been use the that Companies Product using Difference Diagram.
2. Find the nerarest from the result in number one to Distrubution Point with Buffer constraint (parameter).
3. find the best 3 form the result number 2. Which 3 best Distribution Point that nearest from Demand/Costumer Potential.
4. The best one is the green one, then yellow, and the third is red
